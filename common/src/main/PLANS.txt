-------- Staves!! the mainstay. --------
    Extended(?) - DONE
        Normal staff but lorj, offers slightly more grid space (configurable)
        maybe I should change the lang for hex's staves to "wands" instead of calling it extended
	Notes:
	""like the long staves would come with 1 level of a grid expanding enchant for free, but
	you could still go out and apply the enchant manually if you wanted to use one of the
	small staves and get the same functionality"" -Chloe

    Original Staves - DONE
	- spoon staff but the extended version is comically large
		"this staff's name is 'Spoon Theory' look him up on google"
	- also moss staff. need. flowering azalea variants. maybe an glow berrie?
	- prismarine staves for matching to aquatic players, dark variant
	- copper staves?
	- nether-related staves (not quartz, sam covered that), netherrack?
	- end staves > purpur, obsidian?

    Impermanent Staff / Improviser's Staff - DONE
        staff made from amethyst, for people who didn't bring wood into the geode
        - has a media buffer (like a phial, implements MediaHolderItem)
        - breaks like a cypher (cannot be recharged)

    Drawing Orb - DONE
        staff with less grid space
        - you can set it to scry/ponder a position
        - extends ambit to a single entity(?) or block
        - ambit is only granted when the orb is held (in either hand)

    Grand/Great(?) Staves
	casts a hex for each pattern drawn?
		--or--
        implements ItemPackagedHex (is a casting device) BUT:
        - does not have a media buffer of its own
        - has a chargeup time to cast its bound hex(?), as well as the usual cooldown
        - needs a music disc (or similar expensive item) to craft along with
        - cannot be cast from while in the grid
        takes the form of being etched into the wood, a trusty hex the wielder knows by heart

-------- Bookbinding! Customized Spellbooks --------
    Custom Spellbooks that have varying page counts, but with other effects
    - spellbook with lessened pages, but built-in hexbook (rmb opens patchouli book)
    - similar spellbook, that opens a book-and-quill on rmb
    - spellbooks can be made with a specific number of pages

    - crafted from a base item (empty cover)
    - shapeless recipe like a firework to add features
        - focus for 8 pages,
        - & other items for <8
            - (4,2,1?) for granularity
        - hexbook for hexbook on rmb
        - book and quill for gui on rmb
            - maybe make this its own page
              so it has compat with scribes etc
        - artifact maybe? but idk if balanced
	- map for carbon-copy things
	    - rclick to write to shelves
	    - copy to the offand item
    - use nbt data to store rclick action & page count
    

---------Other Hex gear and trinkets --------
    Caster's Head Mirror:
	head trinket, based on the old doctor's headband
	- maybe reflects raycasts?
	    - return null if they hit the wearer
	    - only when originating from a point in the caster's vision?

    Charged Amethyst Diadem:
	- crafted with an empty diadem and charged
	- amethyst on it shatters to prevent hex-related damage 
	    - one-time, turns back into empty diadem after (recraft)
	    - includes bloodcasting and damaging mishaps (like div0)
	- can be made pre-enlighten but is decorative at first, like slates
	- advancement for having it break for the first time
	    - (X) challenge for breaking it as your first bloodcast
	        - ill-advised, locked forever post-enlightenment
	- "It... saved me. ..."

    Budding Amethyst Diadem: (bud diadem)
        a headband that grows tiny clusters from its wearer's brain activity
        - doing certain things can make it briefly go faster (see qualia)

    Bloodletter's Diadem: (blood diadem)
	- a use for the Butcher in flaying!
	- keeps the wearer below a set amount of health, and refunds it as media
	    - grants more media per hp the lower the limit is (player chooses limit)
	        - range is 1/hp to 2/hp? tentative
	- will have like, spikes that lead into the skull (metal af)
	- "it aches, OH HOW IT **ACHES**, but it fills my pockets..."
	- might charge to an internal reservoir, or to held items like rumination
	    - choose which depending on what was flaid (base vs phial one?)

Hex Gear: Rings!
    - one to make a given spell cheaper
	- write a spell pattern to it, reduces the cost
	- constant or percentage? start with half & tweak/config
	- call it the "Ring of Signature Spells"? (D&D reference)
	
    - Silk Touch/Fortune rings (modifies break block)
	- made obselete by hexical patterns, though may be useful for not incurring cost
    - reach ring, that adds some proportion of your reach distance to your ambit
        - could be a hand slot item
